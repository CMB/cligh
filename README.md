# cligh - Command-line Interface to GitHub

This is a simple command-line interface to the facilities of GitHub.
It is written by Christopher Brannon <cmbrannon79@gmail.com>.

## Installation

If you are using a version of Python prior to 2.7, you first need to
install the argparse module.
Get it from [here](http://argparse.googlecode.com/).
Python version 2.7 includes argparse in its standard library.

cligh also requires the python-github2 package.
The homepage for python-github2 is [here](http://github.com/ask/python-github2).

Once the dependencies are installed,
 type `./setup.py` in the cligh source directory, in order to install
the script.

## Usage

Usage is straightforward, and the program provides informative help
messages.  Simply type `cligh -h` at a shell prompt,
to see the introductory help message.
